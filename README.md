### Project Title
**Bikeshare Data Analysis**

### Description
The _bikeshare.py_ file is set up as a script that takes in raw input to reate an interactive experience in the terminal that answers questions about the dataset. There are four questions that will change the answers:

 * Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?
 * Would you like to filter the data by month, date, or not at all?
 * (If they choose month) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?
 * (if they choose day) Which day- Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday or Sunday?

The answers to the questions above determine the city and timeframe on which the data analysis happens. 

There is a chance that any time user is asked for input, they may not enter what you expect, so the code is capable of handling unexpected input without failing. 

### Files used
 - _washington.csv_
 - _newyork.csv_
 - _chicago.csv_
